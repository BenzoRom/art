// Class Status
//
// kStatusRetired: Class that's temporarily used till class linking time
// has its (vtable) size figured out and has been cloned to one with the
// right size which will be the one used later. The old one is retired and
// will be gc'ed once all refs to the class point to the newly
// cloned version.
//
// kStatusErrorUnresolved, kStatusErrorResolved: Class is erroneous. We need
// to distinguish between classes that have been resolved and classes that
// have not. This is important because the const-class instruction needs to
// return a previously resolved class even if its subsequent initialization
// failed. We also need this to decide whether to wrap a previous
// initialization failure in ClassDefNotFound error or not.
//
// kStatusNotReady: If a Class cannot be found in the class table by
// FindClass, it allocates an new one with AllocClass in the
// kStatusNotReady and calls LoadClass. Note if it does find a
// class, it may not be kStatusResolved and it will try to push it
// forward toward kStatusResolved.
//
// kStatusIdx: LoadClass populates with Class with information from
// the DexFile, moving the status to kStatusIdx, indicating that the
// Class value in super_class_ has not been populated. The new Class
// can then be inserted into the classes table.
//
// kStatusLoaded: After taking a lock on Class, the ClassLinker will
// attempt to move a kStatusIdx class forward to kStatusLoaded by
// using ResolveClass to initialize the super_class_ and ensuring the
// interfaces are resolved.
//
// kStatusResolving: Class is just cloned with the right size from
// temporary class that's acting as a placeholder for linking. The old
// class will be retired. New class is set to this status first before
// moving on to being resolved.
//
// kStatusResolved: Still holding the lock on Class, the ClassLinker
// shows linking is complete and fields of the Class populated by making
// it kStatusResolved. Java allows circularities of the form where a super
// class has a field that is of the type of the sub class. We need to be able
// to fully resolve super classes while resolving types for fields.
//
// kStatusRetryVerificationAtRuntime: The verifier sets a class to
// this state if it encounters a soft failure at compile time. This
// often happens when there are unresolved classes in other dex
// files, and this status marks a class as needing to be verified
// again at runtime.
//
// TODO: Explain the other states
